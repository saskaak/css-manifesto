# Introduction

Introducing five tips that will lead to simple and robust CSS that is easy to work with. Here are some things to keep in mind before starting:

* All the examples here are in SCSS but the concepts should be applicable to other CSS preprocessors too.
* If you are using [CSS Modules] or similar solution, some of this will be unnecessary. You might still be interested in tips 3, 4 and 5.
* If you prefer an atomic solution like [Tachyons] you probably won't get much out of this. That's a different paradigm and works with different rules.
* If you don't want to write simple and robust CSS that is easy to work with, stop reading NOW.
* For those of you who are still reading: keep reading for the good stuff.
